# Project ScanTailor-CLI-GUI

_created by Csaba Kovacs. shared via [scantailor-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scantailor-devel/xK537XDatVQ)  google group_

It is a batch processing helper – GUI – for “ScanTailor-CLI” 
(Enhanced version - it may not work for the regular version-).

Works in 2 modes.

1.) Takes images from sub-directories/books and creates “subdirectory.ScanTailor” projects.

[1.5] Manual correction of the created project(s) if needed.

2.) Takes the created projects and finalize them – creates the output images – if filter 6 is given.

It can use “IrfanView” to rotate the images as filter 1.

The project is written in C#.

Usercontrol designtime dll "ComboBoxMC.dll" is added.

All source included no 3 party library used.

Feel free to modify it.
